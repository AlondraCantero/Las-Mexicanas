My client is my aunt, Elodia, she owns El Noa Noa. Our website was not too complex to make it responsive, because we followed what Nick said in How to Make a Website. I wish I had more time to make it more detailed, so customers can get a broad understanding of what we have available in the store.  -Alondra Cantero


My client is my aunt.  My partner and I are making a website for her store, because she does not have one for the store. Our website includes home, about, contact, menu, weekly specials, and money transfers. Our website is going to be useful for the customers. To make our website responsive it was not that diffcult, because we followed what Nick said.  -Lizbet Mendoza
